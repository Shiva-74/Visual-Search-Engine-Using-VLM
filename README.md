# Visual-Search-Engine-Using-VLM
This project implements a visual search engine leveraging state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to retrieve relevant images based on textual queries or sample images. The system embeds both text and images into a shared representation space, allowing for semantic search across modalities.
